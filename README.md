# Die #
__A Language For the Aggressive Programmer__

Die is a language you can use to tell other programmers what you think of them, as well
as make them confused and angry as they try and parse out your code.
It's a simple language, based on the ideas of Brainfuck.

This language is still being built, so if you want to contribute please be advised that changes to the specifications are likely and your code may become deprecated quickly.

I don't personally recommend using this language. But you're certainly welcome to do so!

## Building ##

This interpreter is written from scratch in C. Any standard compiler should do the job without
any issue. I use build scripts in the form of build.sh and build.bat myself.

## Specification ##

Below is the language specification, as I've designed it. Some features in this specification __have not been implemented yet__. They're merely guidelines for what I want to have the language do. Just be aware!

### Cells ###
Programs in Die are made up of an array of _Cells_ and a _Pointer_ to those cells. Each cell starts out with a value of 0 and can be incremented and decremented. The pointer can be moved left and right, and values can be printed. That's all!

### Comments ###
Comments are written like you're talking under your breath.

`... This is a comment`

_Line comments are the only ones that are supported right now._
For funsies, how about just don't use comments?

### Increments & Decrements ###

The central command of the language is die, which is used to increment the current cell value. Various forms of die increment the currently pointed value in certain different ways.

```
die => +1
Die => +10
DIE => +100
```

Optionally, increasing the number of E's multiplies the incrementing value.
`dieeee => +4`

To decrement, the same principals are used but the word is `please`

```
please => -1
Please => -10
PLEASE => -100
```
and it can be multipled again with the number of E's
`pleeeease => -4`

### The Pointer ###
You can move the pointer left and right by using `.` and `go`.

```
go die. => Move to cell 1 and increment by 1, then go back to cell 0.
```

### Loops ###

~Not yet implemented~

While loops are done by using `ok` and `stop`. Whiles are terminated when the current cell is 0. Be aware, this makes it really easy to make infinite loops, by accident.

```
ok
please
die die die
stop
```

For loops are done using `ok so` and `stop`. The number of o's in `so` are how many times it loops.

```
... loop 4 times
ok soooo
die die die die die
stop
```

### Printing ###
Printing can be done in two ways:

`sorry` prints the ascii char of the currently pointed-to variable,
`Sorry` (capitalized) prints the integer value.

### Debug Mode ###
Running die and passing in `--debug` activates debug mode. This will show the read-in source and each operation that is run, in order, as they are done. Excellent for seeing what's really going on! (thanks to [darkfire000](https://github.com/darkfire000) for adding this).
